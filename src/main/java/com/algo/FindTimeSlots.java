 * Google Calendar, Outlook, iCal has been banned from your company! So an intrepid engineer has
 * decided to roll their own implementation. Unfortunately one major missing feature is the ability
 * to find out what time slots are free for a particular individual.
 * 
 * Given a list of time blocks where a particular person is already booked/busy, a start and end
 * time to search between, a minimum duration to search for, find all the blocks of time that a
 * person is free for a potential meeting that will last the aforementioned duration.
 * 
 * Given: start_time, end_time, duration, meetings_list -> suggested_meeting_times
 * 
 * Let's assume we abstract the representation of times as simple integers, so a valid time is any
 * valid integer supported by your environment. Here is an example input:
 * 
 * meetings_list: [3,13],[0,2], [1-7], [16,17], [19,22] start_time: 0 end_time: 24 min_duration: 3
 * expected answer:
 * 
 * free_time: [13,16]
