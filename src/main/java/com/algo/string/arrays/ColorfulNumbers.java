/**
 * Objective: Given a number, find out whether its colorful or not.
 *
 * Colorful Number: When in a given number, product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different. That number is called Colorful Number. See Example

 * Example:
 *
 * Given Number : 3245
 * Output : Colorful
 *
 * Number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245.
 * this number is a colorful number, since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different.
 * That is, 3 2 4 5 (3*2)=6 (2*4)=8 (4*5)=20, (3*2*4)= 24 (2*4*5)= 40
 *
 * Given Number : 326
